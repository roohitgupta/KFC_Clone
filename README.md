KFC is one of biggest restaurant chain in the world, yeah it is true. so I made a clone of it’s original website. here I’m gonna tell you about making of clone of KFC.co.in, so are you ready? don’t you!

First I want you to sit down and listen to me, it’s been a week when I started working on this clone website, yeah right you got me! now the project is complete and summited. I know you’re happy for me. thanks by the way.


so first I make a home page yeah everyone called it a home page. then I put some different sections called Navbar, Crouser, Offer Section, Footer section, etc… in it. Then I make menu page where you can really choose something to order Or decide what you wanna put in your stomach tonight. so when you about to choose the food then you just have to click add to Cart in that particular food Card. yeah that easy! these days ordering online food is much easy as you can’t even think.


so after that in Cart page you got all the selected food of your choice then you just have to ready with your credit card to spent some important money for over priced food. KFC also charged you 16 rupees for nonsense carry bag but you know you’re rich that’s why you thinking about it. am I right yeah I know i am right.

so that’s all, nothing else.

Thankyou!
